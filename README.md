## Repository for Data Science projects

All files here can be used on Google Colab. Some works requires data, which is in the project folder.

1. Navigate to the desired work folder.
2. Import the .ipynb file to your Google Colab.
3. Check if there is a database to run the file. If there is, make sure to import to Colab as well using any of the colab import files methods.
4. Run the workflow.

To run locally, make sure to have the virtual env containing all required dependecies. For some works, some adjustments to the code might be required.

## Included Projects

### WebScrapping
[Project Folder](https://github.com/wanpdsantos/datascience/tree/main/WebScrapping)
This is a simple project showing how to use Python with BeautifulSoup to collect data from web pages. It can be run locally or on Google colab with no need to change code.

### Data Linkage
[Project Folder](https://github.com/wanpdsantos/datascience/tree/main/Spark_DataLinkage)
This is a project to evaluate two databases and indicate the people from database B who are also inserted in database A. The database A and B are also available on the folder. It's designed to run on Google Colab. If you want to run locally, I suggest to create a venv and install the required packages then delete the pip install instructions at the start of the code.

### PUBG - Regression Modeling to predict PUBG Winner
[Project File](https://github.com/wanpdsantos/datascience/blob/main/Regressions/Regression_PUBG_Winner.ipynb)
This one is from a Kaggle challenge. To run this you will need to get the database from the Kaggle challenge (link inside the project file).
